Introduction

The SimpleCalc/DataSciCalc apps are reverse polish notation applications (like the HP calculators) where the operands are entered fully before an operator is selected. The operands entered of course depend on whether a unary of binary operator is to be used. For a simple addition binary operation that would be:

			<OPERAND><ENTER>OPERAND<ENTER><OPERATOR>
			
			i.e.   1<ENTER>2<ENTER><+>
			output  3
			
All operands, including constant keys PI, e, and phi still need and <ENTER> after like any such input.

To assist with chaining of operations, output (results) of operators and functions are always automatically entered entered after being calculated, i.e. the <+> is really a <+>-<ENTER> operation pair.
			
The a unary operation like a SQRT function requires only prior entry of a single operand, and once again the unary operation (being a function) automatically enters the result for the next operation. So that,

			        55<ENTER><SQRT> 
					
				is actually,
				
					55<ENTER><SQRT><ENTER>
					
Where the input is a list, all list items are entered by the keyboard or by appending Xes until the list is built. The a function to operate on all list items is selected. If the function is a binary function an x is entered as well prior to selecting the binary operation ( L^x )
