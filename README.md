# DataSciCalc

A Data Science Calculator project in python
  
A programming project in python to implement with tkinter a simple data science calculator. This is another exercise but free for all to review and use if found helpful.Enjoy.

This is implemented with python 3.7, Tkinter Matplotlib and SciPy and is a work in progress. 

It is growing in functionality as new operations are added, increasingly from the numpy library. Plans are to add a function graphing capability via mathplotlib. I hope you follow allong and comment freely. Afterall, this is first and formost part of my learning experience.

I have tried to open my thinking process to view by including mind maps, doodles and UML models as I develop and grow this application. The screenshot for Version 1.0P is below.
